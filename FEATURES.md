## 8. Bug Fixes and Improvements

### User Deletion Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: When deleting users, multiple users were being deleted
- **Root Cause**: Flawed ID generation logic and inconsistent deletion between mock data and MongoDB
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented proper unique ID generation algorithm
  - Added helper functions for user management
  - Synchronized deletion between mock data and database
  - Improved error handling and validation

### ID Generation Improvements
- **Before**: Simple `(users.length + 1).toString()` which caused conflicts
- **After**: Smart algorithm that finds the next available ID by analyzing existing IDs
- **Benefits**: No more ID conflicts, proper user tracking, consistent deletion

### Data Consistency
- All user operations now properly sync between mock data and MongoDB
- Helper functions ensure consistent behavior across the application
- Better error handling prevents data corruption

### Authentication and Profile Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Users couldn't update profiles or change passwords after removing mock data
- **Root Cause**: APIs were only checking mock data, not the database
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all authentication APIs to check both mock data and database
  - Login now works with database users
  - Profile updates work with database users
  - Password changes work with database users
  - Proper fallback system between data sources

### Multi-Data Source Support
- **Login API**: Checks mock data first, then database
- **Profile API**: Checks both sources for user lookup
- **Profile Update API**: Updates both sources when possible
- **Password Change API**: Works with users from either source
- **Seamless Integration**: Users can authenticate and manage profiles regardless of data source
